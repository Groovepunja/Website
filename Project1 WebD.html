    <h2>Interests/Hobbies</h2>
    <p>
        I grew up down in the south east where the warm weather reigns and the beach calls my name. Meaning of course that I enjoy anything in the water and heat.
        This inludes surfing, snuba, walking on the beach, seashell collecting and tanning. I really enjoy my summer vacation when I try and go back to my home state
        and stay at a condo right next to the beach for a week.

        Something I picked up here in Utah is pickleball. This sport is extremely fun and great for a variety of ages, although its popularity has just
        recently begun to rise. Due to that i'd say there's about twenty people wanting to play for every one court. The maximum a court fits is 4 people since 
        you can play doubles. Currently my skill level is classified as a 3.5 which if one is unfamilair to would be described as pretty good.
    </p>
    <p>
        One of my favorite things to do is walk my two dogs around my parents neighborhood. Their names are Russell and Ollie. Russell is an eight and half year old 
        goolden doodle and Ollie is a five year old labradoodle. They're both definetly a handful but they have very colorful personalitites that show constantly.
        I enjoy their company and like I previously mentioned the walks which I try to make at least half an hour long.
